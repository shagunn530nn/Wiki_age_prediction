## Overview

The Wiki Age Detection project utilizes a dataset of images labeled by age to train a model capable of predicting the age group of individuals. The project includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.

## Notebook Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset of images is loaded, with each image labeled by age.
- **Data Augmentation:** Various data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training data.
- **Normalization:** Image pixel values are normalized to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Definition
- **Model Architecture:** The architecture of the machine learning model is defined, using frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Compilation:** The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

### 3. Model Training
- **Training Process:** The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset, with a specified number of epochs and batch size.
- **Validation:** During training, the model's performance is validated on a separate validation set to monitor for overfitting.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Performance metrics are visualized using plots to provide insights into the model's behavior.

### 5. Prediction
- **Making Predictions:** The trained model is used to make predictions on new images, determining the age group of the individuals.

## Usage

To use the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open the `wiki_age_detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any compatible notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells sequentially to run the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
3. To make predictions on new images, follow the instructions provided in the "Prediction" section of the notebook.

## Results

The notebook provides detailed results of the model's performance, including:
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Visualizations of training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs.
- Example predictions on test images, showcasing the model's ability to predict age groups.
